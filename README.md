# Hi there 👋

## 🚀 About Me

🎓 I am Vanessa Eberhard, a **Front End Web Developer** (specializing in **React Applications**) at Swisscom. In September 2022 I will start with my Bachelor of scienece in IT.

✈️ Even outside the technical world, I am always interested in developing new skills. In my free time I like to **travel** and **meet new people**. This complements well with my interest in **improving my language skills**.

📚 I also love reading books on **personal development** & **psychology**.

🎮 I love participating at **Hackathon** and collect tech stickers.

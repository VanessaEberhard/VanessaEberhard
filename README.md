### Hi there 👋

## 🚀 About Me

🎓 I am Vanessa Eberhard, a **Front End Web Developer** (specializing in **React Applications**) at Swisscom. I will complete my apprenticeship as a **computer scientist** in the summer of 2022.

✈️ Even outside the technical world, I am always interested in developing new skills. In my free time I like to **travel** and **meet new people**. This complements well with my interest in **improving my language skills**.

📚 I also love reading books on **personal development** & **psychology**.
